'''
    This module reads in the specified text file and cleans it for use with
    accuracy and analytical modules.  It returns the "cleaned" file as a list.

    Current version has a Basic function that just strips punctuation and one
    that checks possible hyphenated end of line fusions against a dictionary
    and rules set (optionally).  The Hyphen function is buggy and probably not
    necessary for first pass eval.  I went ahead and included it here to show
    that this module can be structured to include multiple types of token
    generation depending on the level of scrutiny or cleaning desired.
