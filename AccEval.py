'''
    This module evaluates the accuracy of an OCR text.  It accepts, at minimum,
    the text as a list of lines and the dictionary used for evaluation.  It
    also accepts special rule sets (ie, F/S substitution) but will still
    score a text if none is passed in.  If specified, will process tokens
    generated using end of line hyphen fusing.

    Requires: List of lines, processed dictionary.
    Optional: Substitution rules, vebose flag, hyphen flag

    Module returns a tuple of 6 length: total number of capitalized tokens,
    total number of capitalized dictionary matches, total number of capitalized
    matches through subsitution, total number of lower-case tokens, total
    number of lower-case dictionary matches, and total number of lower-case
    matches through substitution.
